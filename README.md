# Enhancing-Target's-Operations-in-Brazil-with-SQL

## About
The Target SQL Business Case Study is an extensive project that highlights the significant role of data analysis in enhancing retail operations, specifically focusing on Target's activities in Brazil. By examining a dataset comprising 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018, the study aims to uncover critical insights that can drive strategic decisions.

This analysis encompasses various dimensions of the business, including order processing efficiency, pricing strategies, and the effectiveness of payment and shipping methods. Additionally, it delves into customer demographics, exploring the characteristics and preferences of Brazilian consumers, as well as assessing product attributes and overall customer satisfaction levels. Through this comprehensive approach, the project seeks to identify opportunities for operational improvements and growth within the Brazilian market.
